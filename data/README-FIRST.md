# DEFAULT DATABASE

This is the default data folder that contains MariaDB database files used for starting the app on localhost, to have a speedy development setup with Docker by using it in docker-compose.yaml, and you should only use it for development.

In production you should always have your own database, credentials, data folder paths pointing to this folder in docker-compose.yaml.
